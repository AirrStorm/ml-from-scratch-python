# ml-from-scratch-python

A collection of machine learning algorithms implemented **from scratch** in **pure Python** with **no external libraries** (except matplotlib for visualization).

This project focuses on the core logic behind ML algorithms, starting from the ground up to help build a deep understanding of their inner workings.

## ✅ Implemented

### 📊 Linear Regression

* [x] **Univariate Linear Regression**
* [x] **Multivariate Linear Regression**
* Uses **Mean Squared Error Loss** and updates weights and bias with **Batch Gradient Descent**
* Pure Python implementation, no external libraries
* Visualizations using **matplotlib** included for both 1D and 2D examples


### 🤖 Perceptron (Binary Classification)

* [x] **Univariate Perceptron**
* [x] **Multivariate Perceptron**
* Uses **0-1 loss** and updates weights with the standard Perceptron rule
* Pure Python implementation, no external libraries
* Visualizations using **matplotlib** included for both 1D and 2D examples

## 🚀 How to Run in Jupyter Notebook

1. Make sure you have Python installed along with Jupyter Notebook.
   You can install Jupyter with:

   ```bash
   pip install notebook matplotlib
   ```

2. Open Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

3. Open the corresponding notebook file:

   * `Linear Regression/univariate.ipynb`
   * `Linear Regression/multivariate.ipynb`
   * `Perceptron/univariate.ipynb`
   * `Perceptron/multivariate.ipynb`

4. Run the cells in the notebook to see the implementation and results.
   All math is implemented using **only Python’s built-in features** — no NumPy or other external libraries.
