# ml-from-scratch-python

A collection of machine learning algorithms implemented **from scratch** in **pure Python** with **no external libraries**.

This project focuses on the core logic behind ML algorithms, starting from the ground up to help build a deep understanding of their inner workings.

## 🚀 How to Run in Jupyter Notebook

1. Make sure you have Python installed along with Jupyter Notebook.
   You can install Jupyter with:

   ```bash
   pip install notebook
   ```

2. Open Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

3. Open the corresponding notebook file:

   * `Linear Regression/univariate.ipynb`
   * `Linear Regression/multivariate.ipynb`

4. Run the cells in the notebook to see the implementation and results.
   All math is implemented using **only Python’s built-in features** — no NumPy or other external libraries.
